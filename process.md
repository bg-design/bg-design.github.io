# Our Process: The Four D's

We follow a proven, human-centered design approach, structured around four key phases. Our process combines the Double Diamond methodology, Agile/Lean sprints, and constant feedback to deliver solutions that truly work — on time and on budget.

      <p><strong>Research:</strong> Stakeholder interviews, user surveys, market and competitor analysis. We dig deep to understand your needs and the landscape.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Ask: "What are we trying to solve?" "Is this the best method?" "Are we sure this is the users' problem?"</li>
        <li>Empathy: The problem the client or user thinks they have isn't always the actual issue, so we constantly ask "Why?" to drill deeper.</li>
        <li>Interview users, gather data, create insights, and form a hypothesis on the central problem.</li>
        <li>Competitive analysis: "Who else has solved this problem?" "How successful were their approaches?"</li>
      </ul>
